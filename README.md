# Expo App

In this assignment we'll build our first React Native application from scratch using version of RN called Expo. React Native Expo is a streamlined version of the React Native framework allowing us to get more done with less code. Expo limits the device specific features we can access to just the most common ones, but in most cases is perfectly suited for creating simple mobile apps.

We'll use the official React Native Expo documentation to walk us through building a web/mobile app that allows us to edit images and access device photo galleries. This tutorial has everything you need to really understand how to build applications with React Native.

Go through the entire tutorial, ensuring you do not skip any steps. When you've completed the tutorial submit a PR to this assignment on Canvas and add your reviewer.
